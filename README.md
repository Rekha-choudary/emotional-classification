# emotional-classification
ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals:
Classify user-provided text into emotional categories.

Display a matching face image to represent that emotion visually.

Deploy the model in a simple and interactive UI (Colab/Jupyter).

Train on a public dataset like Emotion Dataset or Kaggle-based text emotion datasets.
